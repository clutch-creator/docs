Shift, at its core, runs off CSS. There are few, if any, times where you will ask yourself, "How do I _______________ in Shift" in regards to styling. More than likely, the real questions is "How do I ______________ in html/css?" Here we intend to cover the "how" of applying styles in Shift as we offer a unique experience in that regards.

## Modifying a components appearance.

Select the block component we made last section, and click on the 'Components' tab.This tab will open to the 'Style' section by default.

Since there are no styles applied yet, that section is empty. Suggested styles contains those styles commonly used with the selected component. All styles contains all, (yes all 300+) available css properties. Lastly, Raw CSS lets you see and edit the applied styles in CSS form. Again, since there is nothing applied, this will currently be empty.

Styling the element is as simple as inputing values into respective fields. Note how quickly we are able to modify and view an elements appearance. Holding down <kbd>shift</kbd> or <kbd>alt</kbd> while dragging margins/padding will set it for all or opposite sides respectively.

Notice how, after styling the element, the applied styles section contains just those properties you have set.
