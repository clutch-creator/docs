`Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.`

Usually web development is about HTML elements but in the __Shift__ environment everything is treated as components even HTML elements are components, just like the __React's__ concept.
This empowers reusability and isolation aswell as composition.

For a more simple example imagine a HTML page having a Navigation Menu, a Product List, Product search and Footer. Developing the same structure in Shift would have a component for the page, other for the Navigation Menu, the Product List and so on. Each one of the components with its own specifics like Styling, Settings, State, and/or Flow.
((scope needs to be more precise for such a equal topic to React))
