## Dashboard

The __Dashboard__ is your project manager. The projects you create and collaborate with, will be sorted here by last changes. To create a new empty project all you need is to name it.

## Toolbar

The Shift's toolbar is similar to an IDE's. Here you can find not only navigation to the different modes (Design and Code), but also a live-preview of your app with device simulation, connection status, the Export Manager, a magic timeline and your profile.

## Design Mode

The __Canvas__ of your web-app. With the help of Shift's Component-Tree and a set of Component-based tools you will have everything you need to structure, style, connect and preview your components and content.

## Code Mode

Where the code happens, isn't just written. In Code Mode you have all the magic that happens in the backbone of your app, a graphQL connection and it's queries, mutations and subscriptions, aswell as actions as part of the good old Redux store, the chance to develop custom components and where your Stylesheet is joined.

## Routing

Since __Shift__ enables __React's Routing__, there's always need to check your path.

## Preview

__Preview__ your app on the run wihout having to deploy it or simulate how it would be represented in a specific mobile device. It's like you just got your browser and IDE joined, in your browser, it's tricky at times.

## Profile

This is you, a pathway to your dashboard, profile settings and logout in case of a day's end.

## Export

Export your app in seconds, download the bundle and you are ready to deploy. It's not as easy as it is simple.

## Timeline

You might be familiar with the old Undo/Redo actions available in every software where change is happening all the time. So here too it's possible to have a registry of any action and to revert it in case needed.

## Simultaneous Users

Yes, you can design, code and connect all this with multiple users in realtime. This will not only cut through waiting times but will enable for Developers, Designers or Develigners to work together, see changes in real-time and work in a whole new web-app development environment.
