## Dashboard

Your project manager. The projects you create and collaborate with, will be sorted here by last changes. To create a new empty project a name is all that's needed.
<br><br>
## Editor

Because every web-app development needs a battlefield, __Shift's Editor__ is equipped with everything to ease the process. Not only it has a similar look to a development IDE, it is one too. 

### Design Mode

The canvas of your web-app. With the help of Shift's [__Builder__](builder.md) tools and the [__Canvas__](canvas.md) you will have everything you need to structure, style, connect and preview your components and content.
* [__Builder__](builder.md) - Builder is the set of tools to configure and customise all the components.
    * [__The Component tree__](component-tree.md) - Hierarchical tree of components, structure and order.
    * [__Class Editor__](class-editor.md) - Edit all the classes for the component
    * [__Style Editor__](style-editor.md) - Edit all the styles for the component
    * [__Component Settings__](component-settings.md) - Configuration for the component attributes.
    * [__PropsFlow__](propsflow.md) - Props configuration, binding and flow for the component.
    * [__State Settings__](state-settings.md) - State configuration for the component.
* [__Canvas__](canvas.md) - the canvas of your development.
<br><br>
### Code Mode

Where code is. All the magic happening in the backbone of your app is setup and customised in __Code Mode__. Options such as:
* [__Actions__](actions.md) - all about Global and Local state, and its actions.
* [__Dependency Manager__](dependency-manager.md) - They say that big things come in small packages. Any npm package in your app.
* [__GraphiQL__](graphiql.md) - A GraphiQL interface and settings.
    * __Queries__
    * __Mutations__
    * __Subscriptions__
* [__Custom Components__](custom-components.md) - Develop your own Shift Component
* [__Stylesheet__](stylesheet.md) - Where all the styles from your project are collected.
<br><br><br>

## Preview

__Preview__ your app on the run wihout having to deploy it or simulate how it would be represented in a specific mobile device. It's like you just got your browser and IDE joined, in your browser, it's tricky at times.
<br><br>
### Export

Export your app in seconds, download the bundle and you are ready to deploy. It's not as easy as it is simple.
<br>

## Timeline

You might be familiar with the old Undo/Redo actions available in every software where change is happening all the time. So here too it's possible to have a registry of any action and to revert it in case needed.
<br>

## Profile

This is you, a pathway to your dashboard, profile settings and logout in case of a day's end.
<br><br>
## Real-time Collaboration

Yes, you can design, code and connect all this with multiple users in realtime. This will not only cut through waiting times but will enable for Developers, Designers or Develigners to work together, see changes in real-time and work in a whole new web-app development environment.
