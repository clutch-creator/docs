## Editor

Because every web-app development needs a battlefield, __Shift's Editor__ is equipped with everything to ease the process. Not only it has a similar look to a development IDE, it is one too. 

## Dashboard

Your project manager. The projects you create and collaborate with, will be sorted here by last changes. To create a new empty project a name is all that's needed.

## Design Mode

The __Canvas__ of your web-app. With the help of Shift's __Builder__ tools and the __Canvas__ you will have everything you need to structure,style, connect and preview your components and content.

## Code Mode

Where code is. All the magic happening in the backbone of your app is setup and customised in __Code Mode__. Options such as __GraphQL__ connection and it's __Queries__, __Mutations__ and __Subscriptions__, aswell as __Actions__ as part of the good old Flux, the choice to develop __Custom Components__ and where your __Stylesheet__ code is collected.

## Routing

Since __Shift__ enables __React's Routing__, there's always need to check your path.

## Preview

__Preview__ your app on the run wihout having to deploy it or simulate how it would be represented in a specific mobile device. It's like you just got your browser and IDE joined, in your browser, it's tricky at times.

## Profile

This is you, a pathway to your dashboard, profile settings and logout in case of a day's end.

## Export

Export your app in seconds, download the bundle and you are ready to deploy. It's not as easy as it is simple.

## Timeline

You might be familiar with the old Undo/Redo actions available in every software where change is happening all the time. So here too it's possible to have a registry of any action and to revert it in case needed.

## Simultaneous Users

Yes, you can design, code and connect all this with multiple users in realtime. This will not only cut through waiting times but will enable for Developers, Designers or Develigners to work together, see changes in real-time and work in a whole new web-app development environment.
