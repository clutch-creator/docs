The __Canvas__ is where you see all the magic happen. All the changes from styling, interaction, data presentation, and many others __in real-time__. 

Not only it will give you a visual state of your app, it is also an easy way to structure, place and re-organize all your visual components by __dragging__ them into it. With labels, highlights and ruler it will also help you to be more aware of the whole procedure.
