>"The class global attribute is a space-separated list of the classes of the element. Classes allows CSS and Javascript to select and access specific elements" - [__MDN__](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class)


In the Shift's paradigm, classes work exactly on the same principle. It enables the re-use of code, being it CSS or JS.

## How it works?
You can find the __Class Editor__ as a tool from the __Builder's__ toolset. It will show you the Classes information of the selected component.
## What does it do?
In the Class Editor you can: 
* Find classes that are applied to a specific component
* Browse throughout all the classes already available in your project
* Create and Apply or just Create a class
* Check to what components and styles a specific class is used on
