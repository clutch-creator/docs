# Creating A Custom Component
There are two ways to create new component using Shift.

## Using the tree
Any component can be right-clicked in the tree and 'Create New Component' can be selected to create a new component with your selection as it's content. You will simply be asked to name the new component.

## Using the component drawer 
With the component drawer open you can press the 'New Component' button to create a component. A dialog will open asking for you name.

# Components as Code
Regardless of how you choose to create a component the outcome will be similiar: a component of the name you've given will get added to both your component's drawer as well as the Components Code section of your code tab. The only difference will be the presence of the preselected content if created using the tree.
