From the dictionary: __*"A component is a part that combines with other parts to form something bigger"*__. And in web and shift it's no different. Components are the reusable parts that your application consists off. They can hold other components and expose properties to customize how they look or behave.

## Creating a Component

There are two ways to create new components in Shift:

### Using the hierarchy

Any instance can be right-clicked in the hierarchy, by clicking 'New Component' in the context menu that pops up, you'll be promped to input a Component name, by inputting a name and submitting you'll be creating a new Component holding the instance you right-clicked and its children.

### Using the component drawer

With the components drawer open you can press the 'New Component' button to create a component. A dialog will open asking for the new Component name. After submitting it'll create an empty Component.

## Components as Code

Regardless of how you choose to create a component the outcome will be similiar: a component of the name you've given will get added to both your component's drawer as well as a component definition in your project files tab. The only difference will be the presence of the preselected content if created from an existing instance in the hierarchy.
