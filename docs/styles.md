## Media Queries
_"Media queries are useful when you want to apply CSS styles depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen), specific characteristics (such as the width of the browser viewport, or environment (such as ambient light conditions). With the huge variety of internet-connected devices available today, media queries are a vital tool for building websites and apps that are robust enough to work on whatever hardware your users have."_ - MDN
__Shift__ provides its own manager to help forging your own media queries with a simple interface.

It is possible to __name__ a media query, select its __type__, add __values__ and still use the __AND__ and __OR__ conditions.
The media Query will stay stored in the previously chosen __Class__ selector and will have its own style properties.
