To start our project we need a plan.
<br><br>
__What we want to see?__
 - __Messages Dashboard__ - The default path for our application. This is where all the submitted messages will be shown.
 - __Message__ - A Message view where we will have an individual message shown.
 - __Message Form__ - A simple form for Message submission.
<br><br>

__What is a Message in this App context?__

A __Message__ will have the following properties:
 - `id` (unique)
 - `title`
 - `description`
 - `date`
<br><br>

__What we want to happen?__
- Messages to be shown at the Message Dashboard.
- Messages to be submitted through Message Form.
- Store the Messages in a db (Graphcool used in this tutorial as the endpoint).
- If a Message Title is clicked, redirect to the individual Message.
<br><br>

__When we want it?__
- Yesterday.
<br><br><br>
