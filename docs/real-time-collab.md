One of the key features of __Shift__ is the collaboration in __real-time__. __Coding__ and __Designing__ can be done at the same time, remotely and always keeping each operation's order.

This will shortcut through web-app development limitations we know to be real in a every day's work, bringing different variables to take in consideration for a whole new environment where communication is key.

To help with collaboration awareness, the following built-in features are available:
* Visual representation for multiple users
    * Each collaborator has a marker
    * Every operation done on Shift is tracked by user
    * Highlights for each current user place in Shift
* Chat feature
