Using a hierarchical structure, the component-tree provides a visual overview of how components are linked. It's the easiest way to
keep track of structure and to apply changes to each __Shift Component__.

The following commands are available in the Component-Tree:

* __Add__ - Adds a component as a child to the previously selected component.
* __Copy__ `⌘C`- copys the selected component and its child tree.
* __Cut__ `⌘X`- cuts the selected component and its child tree.
* __Delete__ `⌫`- Deletes the selected component and its child tree.
* __Duplicate__ - Duplicates the selected component and its child tree.
* __Import HTML__ - opens the __Import__ interface to import a component or a group of components from HTML.
* __Move to parent__ - moves the selected component to its parent's level in the tree.
* __Paste Inside `⌘V`__- pastes previously content as child of the selected component.
* __Select Parent Component__ - Displays a list of the selected component's parent and its grand parents.
