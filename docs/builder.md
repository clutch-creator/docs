## Component-Tree

Using a hierarchical structure, the component-tree provides a visual overview of how components are linked. It's the easiest way to keep track of structure and to apply changes to each Shift Component.

## Class Editor
"The class global attribute is a space-separated list of the classes of the element. Classes allows CSS and Javascript to select and access specific elements" - MDN
In the Shift's paradigm, classes work exactly on the same principle. It enables the re-use of code, being it CSS or JS.


How it works?
You can find the Class Editor as a tool from the Builder's toolset. It will show you the Classes information of the selected component.


What does it do?
In the Class Editor you can:
* Find classes that are applied to a specific component
* Browse throughout all the classes already available in your project
* Create and Apply or just Create a class
* Check to what components and styles a specific class is used on 


## Style Editor

The Style Editor is a set of tools that allows you to control and customize every aspect of styling. With the visual help of Canvas you can see in real-time all the styling being applied.  


How it works?
You can find the Style Editor as a tool from the Builder'stoolset. It will show you the selected style information.


What does it do?
In the Style Editor you can:
* Edit a style CSS code without actually writting any CSS
* Import raw CSS
* Have a live preview of the result in the Canvas.
* Choose from a set of already well-known and default css properties
* Media Queries, Flex Box, Color palettes, effects, transitions and even much more. 


## Component Settings


The Component Settings deal with the configuration for the selected component. 

How it works?
You can find the Component Settings tab in the Builder's toolset, for setting attributes, events and custom properties.


What does it do?
In the Component Settings you can:
* Set the component specific available attributes
* Set events to the selected component
* Add custom properties to the selected component.  
State Settings

The State Settings tab is responsible for the configuration and updated information of the State of the selected component.    // Image Support //
You can find the State Settings tab in the Builder's toolset when working with a Global State or Local StateComponent.



## Props Flow

The Props Flow the configuration and flow status of the selected component.  


How it works?
You can find the Props Flow tab in the Builder's toolset. It will show you the selected component flow of its props.

Bind

### Canvas Tabs

*talk about how everything works in tabs and its management*

The Canvas is where you see all the magic happen. All the changes from styling, interaction, data presentation, and many others in real-time.
Not only it will give you a visual state of your app, it is also an easy way to structure, place and re-organize all your visual components by dragging them into it. With labels, highlights and ruler it will also help you to be more aware of the whole procedure. 

### Code Tabs


## Real-time Collaboration

One of the key features of Shift is the collaboration in real-time. Coding and Designing can be done at the same time, remotely and always keeping each operation's order.
This will shortcut through web-app development limitations we know to be real in a every day's work, bringing different variables to take in consideration for a whole new environment where communication is key.   To help with collaboration awareness, the following built-in features are available:
* Visual representation for multiple users
    * Each collaborator has a marker
    * Every operation done on Shift is tracked by user
    * Highlights for each current user place in Shift
* Chat feature
