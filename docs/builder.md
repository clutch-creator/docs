## Sidebar

## Component-Tree

Using a hierarchical structure, the component-tree provides a visual overview of how components are linked. It's the easiest way to keep track of structure and to apply changes to each Shift Component.

## Class Editor
"The class global attribute is a space-separated list of the classes of the element. Classes allows CSS and Javascript to select and access specific elements" - MDN
In the Shift's paradigm, classes work exactly on the same principle. It enables the re-use of code, being it CSS or JS.


How it works?
You can find the Class Editor as a tool from the Builder's toolset. It will show you the Classes information of the selected component.


What does it do?
In the Class Editor you can:
* Find classes that are applied to a specific component
* Browse throughout all the classes already available in your project
* Create and Apply or just Create a class
* Check to what components and styles a specific class is used on 


## Style Editor

The Style Editor is a set of tools that allows you to control and customize every aspect of styling. With the visual help of Canvas you can see in real-time all the styling being applied.  


How it works?
You can find the Style Editor as a tool from the Builder'stoolset. It will show you the selected style information.


What does it do?
In the Style Editor you can:
* Edit a style CSS code without actually writting any CSS
* Import raw CSS
* Have a live preview of the result in the Canvas.
* Choose from a set of already well-known and default css properties
* Media Queries, Flex Box, Color palettes, effects, transitions and even much more.

### Canvas Tabs

*talk about how everything works in tabs and its management*

The Canvas is where you see all the magic happen. All the changes from styling, interaction, data presentation, and many others in real-time.
Not only it will give you a visual state of your app, it is also an easy way to structure, place and re-organize all your visual components by dragging them into it. With labels, highlights and ruler it will also help you to be more aware of the whole procedure. 

### Code Tabs


## Real-time Collaboration

One of the key features of Shift is the collaboration in real-time. Coding and Designing can be done at the same time, remotely and always keeping each operation's order.
This will shortcut through web-app development limitations we know to be real in a every day's work, bringing different variables to take in consideration for a whole new environment where communication is key.   To help with collaboration awareness, the following built-in features are available:
* Visual representation for multiple users
    * Each collaborator has a marker
    * Every operation done on Shift is tracked by user
    * Highlights for each current user place in Shift
* Chat feature
