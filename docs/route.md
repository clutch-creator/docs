`"Its most basic responsibility is to render a specific component when a location matches the routeâ€™s path."`

## Component Settings
- [__Default Component settings__](components.md#default-component-settings)
- __Path__ - Specifies the pathname to be matched for the Route
- __Exact match__ - Specifies if the match for the __Path__ is to be exact
- __Default Path__ - Specifies the default path for the Route

### Path
`String`

If a __Route's__ path matches the current location, it's children Components will be rendered.

To determine if a Route component's path prop matches the current location, the [`path-to-regexp`](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) package is used. It compiles de path string into a regular expression which is matched against the current location pathname.

### Exact match
`boolean`

Presented by a checkbox, the option __Exact match__ assures that the match is equal to the __Path__ defined.

### Default path
`String`

Sets the default path for that __Route__. When using params such as `/user/:userid` if the userid in the current location is not matched, the default path will be returned.
