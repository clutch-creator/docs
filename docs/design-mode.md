## Component-Tree

![Component-Tree](/docs/docs/assets/component_tree.png)

The __Component Tree__ is what keeps the order and where the order is kept. This tree is not only a visual representation of your [__Shift Components__](shift-component.md) hierarchy but also what keeps state of all the Routing, Data flow, Structure, and all the heritage from the root to the leaf. With the control to add, remove, edit, duplicate, copy and even [__Import Html__](import.md) it will make a developer's work easier and quicker.

## Canvas

// needs image support //

The __Canvas__ is where you see all the magic happen. All the changes from styling, interaction, data presentation, and many others in real-time. Not only it will give you a visual state of your app, it is also an easy way to structure, place and re-organize all your visual components by dragging them into it. With labels, highlights and ruler it will also help you to be more aware of the whole procedure.

To __Preview__ your changes as if your web-app was already deployed you simply have to click on the play button. You can also simulate different devices, not only to see how your application would behave in one but also to be able to design and work under that context enabling a better mobile development experience.
