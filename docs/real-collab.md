One of the most ambitious features of __Shift__ is to provide __Real Time Collaboration__ for any __Team__ developing its projects. 

Since the work of Designers and Coders is always separated by 'how it looks' and 'how it works' it takes of the normal procedure to develop an application because of this lack of communication.

__Shift__ joins this two efforts so that Designers can make functionality and Coders can paint the app at the same time and therefore shortcutting through time.

All this happens in the browser, so the need for a complete stack of different softwares to actually solve a problem decreases drastically.
