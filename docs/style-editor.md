## How it works?
You can find the __Style Editor__ as a tool from the __Builder's__ toolset. It will show you the selected style information.
## What does it do?
In the Style Editor you can: 
* Edit a style CSS code without actually writting any CSS
* Import raw CSS
* Have a __live preview__ of the result in the __Canvas__.
* Choose from a set of already well-known and default css properties
* __Media Queries__, __Flex Box__, __Color palettes__, effects, transitions and even much more.
