## Structure

## Presentational vs Container Components
It's easier to organize, reuse and think in components using the Presentational Component and Container Component patterns. They often are referred as Dumb and Smart, Pure and Stateful, Skinny and Fat, Screens and Components, and other conventions but the core ideia is the same when it comes to two different types of components.

This concepts will make it easier to sepparate the layers of "layout" and "logic and data" in the way we use and develop components.
