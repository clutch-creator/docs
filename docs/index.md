To get started with using __Shift__, please refer to this guide for configuration and start up.


## Minimum Requirements

In order for you to run Shift, you must be running Google Chrome (version X) or higher. Shift runs on your browser, so you don’t need to install it, and runs perfectly on any machine.

## Accessing Shift

If you haven’t done so already, you can access Shift [__here__](https://app.shift.studio/).

## Using Shift on other computers

Shift can be used on any computer without the need to export or import any configuration. Shift saves your data in the cloud, therefore everything you do, if you have an internet connection, is immediately saved. You can also work offline, your operations will be stored locally until you're back online, your operations will then sync with the server.

## Contacting Support
